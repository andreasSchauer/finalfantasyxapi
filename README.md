Things I plan on adding:
- images
- pretty much everything regarding blitzball
- html responses
- a front-end



Things that are currently unclear/unknown:
- There is conflicting information on song credits on the internet
- Some names of areas I can't check, because I currently only have access to the German PS2 version of the game and thus am dependant on English videos and resources:
    - all of dream zanarkand (except overpass, where the save sphere is) (areas 1 to 5)
    - the story-only area in kilika where the sending is performed (area 50; currently called 'square' derived from its German name 'Marktplatz')
    - the road at macalania temple that connects the antechamber with the chamber of the fayth (area 167). In the German version it has the same name as the road that leads to the temple
    - which fayth areas are called 'chamber of the fayth' and which are called 'fayth'? (areas 14, 35, 63, 117, 168, 210, 212, 228)
- What is the critical plus value of monsters? (not equipment drops, but for their own abilities) Is it the same?
